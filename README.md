# My C Noob Filez

Here lies the practice files re: my better understanding C.

Some of it are legit mini-projects, some are exercises from different C programming books and courses all over the internet.

None of which are really polished for practical purposes, I think.

## Why C?

I like the idea of creating a software that's "closer" to the hardware, and C might just be the programming language for that.

Plus, software written in C can be so simple and portable!

Go is another compiled language that interests me, but I'll save that for the future.
